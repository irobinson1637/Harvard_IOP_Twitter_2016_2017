Now I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility, not just to their biggest shareholders, but to their workers, to their customers, to their communities and, yes, to their country, to the United States of America. We have been moving off track for decades. I dont need to tell you that. You know it. You lived it. You have seen it. It is time to get back on track. And you can ask anybody whos worked for me or with me, whos served with me. When I try to do something I will get up every day and work my heart out for you.
