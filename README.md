In order to run the main_news_sentiment.py file, follow the following commands: <br>
1. List each datafile you want to add in a text file. Look at raw_news_data_files.txt as an example. <br>
2. Then in terminal, run: python main_news_sentiment.py raw_news_data_files.txt nyt <br>
Replace 'raw_news_data_files.txt with whichever file you created in step one. Replace nyt with the name of the news source you're compiling. Make sure there are no spaces in the news source name.
